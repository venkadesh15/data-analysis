Nigeria-COVID-19-Data-Analysis-Using-Python
This project leverages data analytics skills in collecting, exploring, perform analysis, create visualizations, and generate insights of COVID-19 data central to Nigeria in terms of penetration of the virus across each states, Real Domestic Gross Product and State Budget in relation to the pandemics.

PROJECT OVERVIEW
Nigeria is a country with 37 states - Federal Capital Territory included- and a fast-growing economic environment with about 200 million citizens. COVID-19 has affected several country activities as the country steadily progressed from its first case to shutting down major airports, state-wide lockdown, curfews, and reviving its economy. Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus, and it has affected major parts of the world. Nigeria, a West-African country, has also been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic after recording its first case on 27th February 2020.

PROJECT OBJECTIVE
In this project, data science and analytics skills are employed to collect data, explore the data, perform analysis, create visualizations, and generate insights.

DATA INFORMATION
Data was extracted from diverse sources using different techniques which includes but not limited to web scrapping or extraction, forking and cloning of GitHub and other sources. Some brief information about the data is given below.

The Nigeria Centre for Diseases Control (NCDC) which contains the states affected by the virus, the number of cases on confirmation and admission, number of discharged, and number of death.

The Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE) publishes daily data on confirmed, death and recovered cases across different countries. We are to extract data for Nigeria only from these data source.

Nigeria Community Vulnerability Index data. The vulnerability index was computed by considering several factors such as socio-economic status, population density, housing type, transportation, epidemiological, health system etc., these factors are known as themes.

Real Domestic Gross Product Data for Nigeria. This data is needed to get the impact of COVID-19 on the Nigeria Economy.

State Budget Data is provided also to support the analysis and infer on how the COVID-19 pandemics affected the economy of Nigeria and the state within it.

ANALYSIS QUESTION
These are some question that my exploration seek to answer upon analysis of given data and data collected from diverse sources.
Exploring the distribution of the virus across each states and the numeric effect on each state. Simply put, the distribution of the confirmed, discharged and the death cases in Nigeria state.
Explore to get the correlation/relatedness of the features listed above and making inference based on the correlation. From John Hopkin’s data, getting the active cases in all countries and extracting the out Nigeria out for analysis
Analyze the relation between the confirmed cases, recovery cases and death instance and to use this to compute the infection rate across the country.
Exploring and making inferences from the distribution of the infection rate based on the dates given in the date dataset.
Investigating and analysis of the some certain index in the external data. These index includes fragility, vulnerability, epidemiology, prevalence, health care, population density, transportation and socio-economic index
Exploration of data based on this indexes to get graphs and chart that is better for communication and inferences
Analysis of the external GDP data to gain insight on the effect of COVID-19 pandemic on the country's’ economy
Further insight from respect state budget and revision to get more insight on the effect of the virus on Nigeria’s economy.
ANALYSIS METHODOLOGY
a) Use of web Scraping or extraction in collecting data from diverse sources

b) Cleaning and preparation of data to standard format in order to be ready for analysis and insight getting from the data.

c) Analysis and Visualization of data to find useful insight and trend from the data.

d) Summary report or documentation to communicate the inferences

CONCLUSION
Based on the analysis and series of inferences above from various data provided, we can infer that the COVID-19 pandemic has a great effect on the economy of Nigeria and lives of many citizens of the country during the prevalence period of the virus. It is noteworthy the leaders of the country must try as much as possible to combat this pandemic cause in terms of health and economic mitigations.
